To use this example, you need to have both I2Cdev and MPU6050 libs,
you can find them (hopefully) on the git project link:

https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino

You have to copy the directories I2Cdev and MPU6050 to arduino libraries folder.
(HINT: You can copy the directories from this folder too. Much easier =)!)
